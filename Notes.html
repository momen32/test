      <h2> the Recognition Afghanistan</h2>
    <p>while Google use the Islamic republic of Afghanistan's flag, Wikipedia editors seems to agree its not the current <em>de facto</em> flag of Afghanistan, and they use the islamic emirte of Afghanistan instead, which is basically the taliban flag. </p>
    <p>which I believe is fair for both sides because there's not a single country that recognized the IEA "Islamic emirte of Afghanistan" and in the same time it's the <em>de facto</em> flag of Afghanistan and even government of them </p>
    <p> while the world stage is heating up, we will see where things are going.</p>
    reasons why its not recognized by government 
    <ul> 
    <li> its basically a rebellion and others believe its controlled by a terrorist organization </li>
    <li> no one want to look like the freak that recognized a terrorist group</li>
    <li> some think it dosen't follow human rights laws</li>
    <h5>anyway, we will have to see in the future where things is going to.</h5> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
